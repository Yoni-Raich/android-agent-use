# Progress

## Status — 2026-09-09

Android Agent is a Developer Preview. It is useful for local testing, but it is
not production-ready.

### Verified

- The v0.6.0 dev APK builds with the Codex runtime staging step.
- The recorded v0.6.0 full gate passed on 2026-09-08:
  `test`, `assembleDevRelease`, `assembleDevDebugAndroidTest`, and
  `:voice:lintDebug`, plus the runtime staging tests.
- The current screen-awake change passed focused JVM tests and a dev debug
  build on 2026-09-09. A designated Android 13 test phone kept its screen on
  during a typed run and released the wake lock when the run ended.
- The app has Compose chat, per-session workspace storage, Codex app-server
  integration, Wireless ADB support, an accessibility device backend, visible
  control state, local Stop, skills, workflows, and experimental realtime voice
  paths.

### Not proven yet

- A complete signed-in Codex chat and device-control flow on a supported phone.
- Reliable same-phone Wireless ADB pairing, reconnect, and app-UID self-ADB.
- Full physical checks for accessibility, voice, overlay visuals, recovery,
  and all device tools.
- Production signing, production packaging, and production readiness.

The x86_64 emulator app-server currently exits with `SIGSYS` (exit code 159),
so emulator runtime success must not be inferred from APK installation or
Compose fixture tests. The project-wide `:app:lintDevDebug` task also has a
known pre-existing failure in `AgentInputMethodService.kt`; see
[Known issues](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

Build output and test results are evidence for those exact checks only. They do
not prove real phone, visual, account, network, or end-to-end success.

Detailed historical evidence is preserved in
[docs/history/PROGRESS-2026-09-09.md](docs/history/PROGRESS-2026-09-09.md).
See the [testing guide](docs/TESTING.md) for the current evidence rules.
